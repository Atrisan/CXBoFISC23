# Abstract
Continuous Integration is an important part of modern software development in which the HPC community has been lacking behind for many years. Recently, in many collaboration CI got more and more traction, including ECP, JLESC, NHR and many more. Due to additional restrictions in terms of software, resources and security/safety supporting CI in common HPC centers is not a trivial task. 

Both HPC users and providers can greatly benefit from CI by automating tests, benchmarks, system checks or software deployment on the targeted HPC systems. Such tests are especially important for more complex applications which is generally the case for most applications on HPC. Since highly optimized codes tend to be hardware dependent many tests can only be performed on specific HPC architectures. Even for portability driven code testing on different architectures is important to avoid performance degradation. Thus, automating tests and even benchmarks would be beneficial for most HPC applications.

The goal of this BoF session is to bring together the developers of CI in HPC to exchange experiences and further the development of corresponding tools. As well as, providing an opportunity for HPC users to voice their needs and wishes regarding CI directly to the developer. By offering a platform outside of the HPC providers current user-base they can anticipate future needs and services for their local HPC center.


# Structure
By having invited talks from people developing CI in HPC solutions as well as invited talks from people presenting their use-cases for CI in HPC this should spark a discussion at least between the presenters. This discussion if not already integrating the audience will then be extended to the audience in terms of their needs/restrictions/ideas as a HPC user/provider or CI in HPC developers.
The session is also structured towards an interactive discussion by starting with all invited talks and combining the Q and A parts for all talks. This should allow an interactive discussion to from naturally based on questions/comments from the audience. The discussion will be loosely guided to avoid going of topic while not restricting the discussion.


# Target Audience
The target audience for this BoF session are HPC users who are interested in using CI to test/benchmark their applications and HPC tools. We further target HPC providers interested in making CI available for their systems and users. CI in HPC developers are also targeted and are available through some invited talks.
